[An introduction to NodeJS and Express](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction)

1. Explain middleware, answer as though I were a non-technical recruiter.

3. Name at lest 2 individual pitfalls and at least 2 team pitfalls commonly encountered while writing tests.

    ```
    Individual Pitfalls:
      - forgetting to run tests frequently
      - writing too many tests as once

    Team Pitfalls:
      - partial adoption
      - poor maintenance of test suite
    ```

[CI/CD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSv_m3KhUO8)

1. What are three benefits of Continuous Integration?

    ```
    - ensure all changes integrate
    - catch bugs
    - reduce merge conflicts

2. What is the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment?

    ```
    Continuous delivery is the practice of developing software
