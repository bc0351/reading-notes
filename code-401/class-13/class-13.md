## Reading
[Socket.io Chat Example](https://socket.io/get-started/chat/)

1. Explain to a non-technical recruiter what the Chat Example (above) does.

    ```
    This chat example combines a couple different technologies to build out a chat app available over the internet.
    ```

2. What proof of life are we getting on the backend from the above app?

    ```javascript
    io.on('connection'...)
    ```

3. Socket.IO gives us the i0.emit() method to send an event to everyone. What flag would you use if you want to send a message to everyone except for a certain emitting socket?

    ```javascript
    io.on('connection', (socket) => {
      socket.broadcast.emit('hi');
    });
    ```

[Rooms](https://socket.io/docs/v4/rooms)

1. What is a room and how might a room be useful?

    ```
    channels; can be used to broadcast to subsets of clients.
    ```

2. How do you join a room?

    ```javascript
    io.on("connection", (socket) => {
      socket.join("some room");
    });
    ```

3. How do you leave a room?

    ```javascript
    io.on("connection", (socket) => {
      socket.leave("some room");
    });
    ```

[Namespaces](https://socket.io/docs/v4/namespaces/)

1. What is a Namespace and what does it allow you to do?

    ```
    A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of your application over a single shared connection (also called "multiplexing").
    ```

2. Each namespace potentially has its own what? (hint: 3 things)

    ```
    event handlers; rooms; middlewares
    ```

3. Discuss a possible use case for separate namespaces

    ```
    your application has multiple tenants so you want to dynamically create one namespace per tenant
    ```
