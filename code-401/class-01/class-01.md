1. How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?

    ```

    ```
2. What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?

    ```
    Developers typically begin implementing the code to an application in an IDE. IDEs will have all the necessary components to implement, compile, build, and run the code. Runtimes execute code in "runtime" environment, presenting to the user the intended output/UI. Node is a runtime environment for JavaScript, where the usual "runtime environment" is the Client's browser.
    ```
3. What is Node used for?

    ```
    Node is predominantly used as a package manager (npm) and running JavaScript server-side.
