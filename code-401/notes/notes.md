# Notes

## Prep: Practice in the Terminal

### **The Command Line**

  ```
      A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
  ```
### Basic Navigation

  ```
  To be transparent, I am familiar with the CLI in UNIX/Linux environments as well as MS. The user typically navigates with cd (change directory) to either relative or absolute paths.
  ```
### More About Files

  ```
  The basics, and more, on files. This section outlined the rules of CLIs. Important notes are case sensitivty, quotes (for spaces in filenames), and escape characters (backslash). For listing files, we use the 'ls' command with flags. My typical ls flags are -altr' to show all hidden and non-hidden, permissions, and to sort in reverse chronological order.
  ```

### Manual Pages

  ```
  The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept.
  ```

### File Manipulation

  ```
  mkdir is used to create directories. rmdir is used to remove directories. Interestingly, I've always used rm -rf to remove directories and all files in the directory.
  ```

### Cheat Sheet
  ```
  Cheat sheets are great. I always have cheat sheets bookmarked for all the various systems/apps/languages I use.
