Review the Submission Instructions for guidance on completing and submitting this assignment.

## Reading
[Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

1. What is a Web Socket?

    ```
    a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection
    ```

2. Describe the Web Socket request/response handshake and what happens once the connection is established.

    ```
    the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header[3] to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.

    a persistent connection is used, meaning lower overhead.
    ```

3. Web Sockets provide a standardized way for the server to send content to a client without first receiving a ____ from that client.

    ```
   request
    ```

[Socket.io Tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/socket.io/)

1. What does the event handler io.on() do?

    ```
    flips the connection on.
    ```

2. Describe some possible proof of life or proof that the code works as expected

    ```javascript
    test("should work", (done) => {
      clientSocket.on("hello", (arg) => {
        expect(arg).toBe("world");
        done();
      });
      serverSocket.emit("hello", "world");
    });
    ```

3. What does socket.emit() do?

    ```
    replicates emitting event, on socket connection
    ```

[Socket.io vs Web Sockets](https://www.educba.com/websocket-vs-socket-io/)

1. What is the difference between WebSocket and Socket.IO? (think Git and GitHub, or OAuth and Auth0).

    ```
    Websocket is the communicationprotocol. socket.io is a library that uses the WebSocket protocol to provide the interface.
    ```

2. When would you use Socket.IO?

    ```
    when you need to braodcast and/or have fallback options.
    ```

3. When would you use WebSockets?

    ```
    when you don't need to braodcast and/or have fallback options.
    ```

## Videos

[OSI Model Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vv4y_uOneC0)

1. What are a couple of key takeaways from this video?

    ```
    There are many layers to consider to fully consider a viable solution.
    ```

[TCP Handshakes Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMtP5ZB3wSk)

1. Translate the gist of this video to a non-technical friend

    ```
    whenever logging on to a web page,  a session is created. data is transferred over that session while browsing the web site, then the session closes once you leave the website.
    ```
