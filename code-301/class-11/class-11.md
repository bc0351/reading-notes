| **SQL**                      | **NoSQL**                      |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| RDBMS                        | Object-based                   |
| Horizontally-scaled          | Vertically-scaled              |
| Structured data              | Unstructured Data              |
| Structured querying language | Unstructured querying language |
| Good for complex queries     | Not good for complex queries   |
| Flat data                    | Hierarchical data              |


1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

    > flat (normalized) data

2. Give a real world example.

    > Transactional data with order flow (stock market orders)

3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

    > Hierarchical data

4. Give a real world example.

    > A company's financials (e.g. ledgers, journals, accounts)

5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

    > Object based, e.g. Oracle.

6. Which type of database is best for scalability?

    > Non-relational

[![SQL vs NoSQL or MySQL vs MongoDB](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ZS_kXvOeQ5Y/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_kXvOeQ5Y "SQL vs NoSQL or MySQL vs MongoDB")

1. What does SQL stand for?

    > Structured Querying Language

2. What is a relational database?

    > a store of tabular data (tables) related to each other with primary/foreign keys, parent/child, one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.

3. What type of structure does a relational database work with?

    > tabular (structured)
    
4. What is a ‘schema’?

    > a 'dictionary' of objects in a database, including tables, users, functions, etc.
    
5. What is a NoSQL database?

    > No pre-defined relationships/schemas
    
6. How does it work?

    > Data is denormalized. One entry exists in many collections.
    
7. What is inside of a Mongo database?

    > collections of **documents**
    
8. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

    > MongoDB. It's essentially a matrixed linked-list
    
9. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

    > size can quickly become the cost.
    
## Things I want to know more about

    > fastest sorting and search methodology
